FRAMEWORK
  Activities are categorized into three types.
  
  A-1) Fundamental: required for the continuity of life on personal level,
       and are cobounding variables e.g sleep, eat, etc.
  A-2) Essential: assumed to enhance the well-being,
       and are cobounding, or explanatory varibles e.g sex, workout, meditation, etc.
  A-3) Upper: activities that define one's attitudes, goals, and life meaning.
       and are explanatory variables e.g volunteer work, study, wikipedia editing, musical play etc.
  *examples mentioned are just one combination of human activities, or lifestyle.

  Assumptions:
    a) A-1, A-2 are explanatory variables, A-2, A-3 are response variables.
       (A-1)--(affects)-->(A-2)--(affects)-->(A-3)
         |                                     |
         ---->>>-------(affects)------>>>-------
       *see ANALYSIS.Interest below.
    b) extend, or frequence of A-1, A-2 should be reduced as possible,
       for the sake of productivity in A-3.
    c) A-3 activities can have different priorities, which expressed by each extend of time,
       and is optimal if it's high in total productivity, and longer in time.
    d) experimental user is assumed no to be forced for A-3.

ANALYSIS
  Guidlines:
        1) every record is precious, hence no sampling is applied.
  Interest: "direction of analysis flows towards upper activities (A-1)->(A-3)"
        direction of calculation flows from every defined explanatory
        to every response variable, although in reality direction can
        be otherwise.
  Search:
        1) "find the optimal combination of A-1, and A-2 that affect A-3 the most"
           reference point has to be know against experimental sample.
           Algorithm:
           1) find optimal combination of points, through predefined priority, deep leanring.
           2) find A-1(prime) combination that has the same effect on A-2, but less in time than A-1.
           3) return A-1 effect on A-2, including the prime effect "the one with shortest time",
              and A-2 effect A-3, including the optimal.
